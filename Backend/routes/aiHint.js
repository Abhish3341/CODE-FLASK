Problem Title: ${problem.title}

Problem Category: ${problem.category}

Problem Description:
${problem.description}

The user is coding in ${language.toUpperCase()} and wrote the following code (may be partial, incomplete, or have errors):
\`\`\`${language}
${code}
\`\`\`

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Give a helpful, beginner-friendly hint that guides them toward the solution
- DO NOT provide the complete solution or full working code
- Focus on conceptual understanding and problem-solving approach
- Suggest algorithmic thinking, data structures, or debugging strategies
- Keep the hint concise (2-3 sentences maximum)
- Encourage independent problem-solving
- If the code has obvious syntax errors, mention them briefly
- If the approach seems wrong, suggest a better direction without giving away the answer
